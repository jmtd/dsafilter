Create `Changelog' from the old `cvs log' output
Modify the Subject line for the can't-determine-package case: include
the DSA number for clarity (same as the no-GPG case)

2005-11-29 13:15:13 +0000

merge in our release-2 fixes

2005-11-07 17:43:55 +0000

branches:  1.29.2;
insert fingerprints for the debian security team in the allowed list

2005-11-07 17:28:05 +0000

added licence, GPL-2.

2005-11-07 00:06:13 +0000

fix major bug where we compare an Array to a String

change approach to calling dpkg; now there's only one dpkg call ever (much
faster), the trade-off is if a package name is long (long enough to be
truncated by dpkg with $COLUMNS=255) we will get an inaccurate answer

2005-11-06 21:36:18 +0000

more work on GPG checks

2005-11-02 22:27:29 +0000

sigcheck.rb: the logic for determining if the fingerprint is ok

2005-10-31 18:31:19 +0000

fix the GPG binary check

2005-10-31 15:17:09 +0000

bug fix (major): uniq! doesn't return the array; uniq returns a new one
(use latter)
check for a gpg binary before we try to verify the sig

2005-10-31 12:47:30 +0000

added a Date and From fields to the DSA mail

2005-10-30 21:45:27 +0000

fix a logic error when filtering out which packages are vulnerable

2005-10-30 21:33:20 +0000

call out to "apt-cache showsrc" to determine which binary packages might be
vulnerable and list them in the mail

2005-10-30 19:19:11 +0000

some notes about libdpkg-ruby1.8

2005-10-25 19:18:57 +0000

finish adjusting the header appends

2005-10-25 19:08:06 +0000

use Header.add rather than += to stop duplicating the Subject: header
a pointer to two RFCs worth reading

2005-10-24 22:34:07 +0000

some TODOs: we're duplicating headers
two/three syntax errors fixed - the incomplete path checking code disabled
TODOs: need to write some other headers (e.g. 'To:')

2005-10-24 22:15:50 +0000

* shift RMail::Message instantiation later on (so it's not done if we
  bail out early)
* remove header code comment (since we've abandoned them)
* preliminary loop to check for a gpg binary
* add a TODO: interpret GPG error messages
* compact array push operations (<<)

2005-10-24 19:59:43 +0000

add a vim modeline
add 'begin' and 'end' bookends, to facilitate adding exception checking
change indentation (2-space)
shell escaping issue addressed
deal with multipart DSAs (although I don't know if any exist yet, they might)
adjust package-regexp to match according to debian policy
complete the move to the new-mail model

2005-10-23 22:06:41 +0000

(major) attach DSA to a new dsafilter message rather than modify the DSA
(minor) move the tempfile code to be next to the GPG checking section
(minor) a handful more TODOs

2005-10-23 15:36:48 +0000

just remove a comment

2005-10-20 10:19:48 +0000

branches:  1.11.2;
exit with an error so procmail delivers the message (rather than
delivering a 0-byte message).

2005-10-20 10:14:06 +0000

check for X-DSAFilter-Results header to avoid loops

2005-10-19 20:13:42 +0000

write out the decoded body to a tempfile and ask GPG to verify it. Indicate
failure with a new error code+message.
A handful of TODOs.

2005-10-16 09:51:14 +0000

break if we find the package (stop scanning the rest of the mail)

2005-10-13 19:49:26 +0000

adopt sa-style headers

2005-10-13 19:25:25 +0000

adjust dpkg call to clear STDERR

2005-10-13 19:15:57 +0000

remove a superfluous print statement

2005-10-13 19:06:02 +0000

check for installed packages and do things accordingly

2005-10-13 16:36:05 +0000

start trying to merge in some of the DSA logic to rmail.rb

2005-10-13 11:59:18 +0000

fix Id string

2005-10-13 11:58:13 +0000

added rmail.rb ; rmail experiments

2005-11-07 17:36:00 +0000

added licence preamble

2005-10-31 18:44:38 +0000

move tempfile stuff down into the GPG area
backport expanded gpg checking from trunk
backport source => [binary] stuff from trunk
some tab removal
re-order the package codes

2005-10-24 22:23:48 +0000

changes taken from the trunk:
	* remove old TODO re: signature checking
	* add two TODOs to the gpg section (other failure possibilities)
	* handle the case where the DSA is a multipart message
	* tweak the regexp to abide debian policy for package names
	* prevent potential shell problems with dpkg callout

2005-11-24 22:53:36 +0000

* wrap-up the package-extraction code in a subroutine
* clean up the Subject lines: indicate
  	hostname of computer
  	DSA number
  	package
  where appropriate.

2005-11-12 15:55:33 +0000

cut out a big chunk of GPG error-checking code.
