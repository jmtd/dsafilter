INSTALLING DSAFILTER
Last modified Tue Dec 13 11:31:55 GMT 2005

Step 1: prepare GPG

  dsafilter requires the user you plan to run it as to have GnuPG
  available in the $PATH and to be setup with knowledge of the keys
  used to sign DSAs (see note 1)

  apt-get install gnupg debian-keyring
  mkdir -p ~/.gnupg
  cat >>~/.gnupg/gpg.conf<<EOF
  keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.gpg
  keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-keyring.pgp
  EOF

  The first run of dsafilter may take a while as gnupg churns its way
  over the debian keyring.

Step 2: setup something to forward DSAs to dsafilter

  You need to invoke dsafilter somehow. I do it via procmail, using a
  recipe like the following:

  :0fw: .dsafilter.lock
  *^Subject: \[SECURITY\] \[DSA
  | /home/jon/bin/dsafilter

  (regarding the lockfile, see note 2)

Step 3: setup something to filter the resulting mail

  Now dsafilter has replaced the DSA with it's own email, you will
  want to filter those mails, perhaps discarding those which are not
  interesting. A procmail recipe like the following will do it:

  :0
  * ^Subject: \[dsafilter\]
  {
    # keep applicable DSA mails
    :0
    * ^Subject:.*of interest$
    some-destination-mailbox

    # discard others
    :0
    /dev/null
  }

  (see note 3)


NOTES

1. This is not a limitation for me personally which is why I have not
   provided an alternative way of doing things. If anyone who wishes
   to use this script is not happy with importing the debian keyring
   in this manner, get in touch.

2. The lock file is not necessary, but I use it just in case the
   process goes mad for some reason, there will only be one broken
   dsafilter process at once.

3. The example recipe matches on the Subject line, inspecting the
   beginning for [dsafilter] and the end for "of interest". I will
   perhaps add a header like "X-DSAFilter-Result" with a numeric code
   which can be matched more easily.
