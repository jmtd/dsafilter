Introduction

   dsafilter is a script designed to filter Debian Security
   Advisories (DSAs). It was written to scratch two itches:
    1. To bin DSAs for packages I do not have installed
    2. To send me a mail for each computer the DSA is applicable to, so I
       can use the emails as a TODO-list, deleting each DSA as the
       corresponding machine is upgraded.

   dsafilter so far only satisfies the first of my two itches, namely,
   identifying whether a given DSA is applicable to the machine on which
   the filter is run.

   DSAs that pass through the filter are wrapped up in an email which
   summarises whether the DSA had a valid signature and whether the
   package(s) it applies to are installed, all in the subject.

   Presently, this version relies on GnuPG being installed, the gpg
   binary being in the $PATH variable, and the public key used to sign
   genuine DSAs (available in package debian-keyring) imported into the
   user's GPG keyring.
